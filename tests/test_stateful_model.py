# UNIT TESTS
# Test generating state
# RAG generate (expected failure)
# Combine states
# Update state
# Forward with generated state and show logits are different


# POSSIBLE INTEGRATION TESTS
# Test loading model from pretrained (Hugging Face)
# Test loading state from local cache
# Test loading state from test_db
# Test saving state to local cache
# Test uploading state to test_db
